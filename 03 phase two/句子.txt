# My Friends at the Farm

Last week, I went to visit my grandpa's farm. It was so much fun! I saw many animals there.

First, I met a big brown horse. The horse was very friendly. I gave him some carrots to eat. He was so tall!

Then I saw a cute little pig rolling in the mud. The pig looked very happy and made funny sounds. "Oink, oink!" said the pig.

My grandpa's cat was sleeping under a tree. The cat had soft orange fur. When I called her name, she opened her eyes and said "Meow!"

A small dog ran up to me. His tail was wagging so fast! The dog wanted to play with me. We played catch with a red ball.

I also saw a tiny mouse running very quickly across the yard. The mouse was looking for some cheese, I think.

The funniest animal was a monkey that lived in a big tree. The monkey jumped from branch to branch. He made me laugh so much!

I love all the animals at grandpa's farm. I want to visit them again soon. Animals are the best friends ever!
