# My Garden Adventure

Hello! My name is Lily. I want to tell you about my garden.

In my garden, there is a big tree. The tree is very tall and green. Under the tree, I can see many beautiful flowers The flowers are red, yellow, and pink. They smell very nice.

Next to the flowers, there is some bamboo. The bamboo is green and tall too. It moves in the wind. I like the sound it makes.

Yesterday, I found a small mushroom near the tree. The mushroom was brown and round. My mom said, "Don't touch it, Lily!" So I just looked at it.

On the tree, there are sweet apples. The apples are red and big. I can pick them and eat them. They are very yummy!

Behind the bamboo, there are purple grapes. The grapes grow in bunches. They are small and sweet. I like to eat grapes with my friends.

I love my garden very much. Every day, I water the flowers and look at the tree. The garden makes me happy. Do you have a garden too?
